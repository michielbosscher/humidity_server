This is a quick and dirty humidity sensor and thermistor reading web server. It just takes the humidity sensor and thermistor readings and responds to http requests with them. It also supports json output. If I keep it online you can find it running at http://xorrbit.no-ip.org:1337/

It uses the enc28j60 and ethershield libraries from http://trollmaker.com/article11/arduino-1-0-with-enc28j60-ethernet-shield-v1-1
