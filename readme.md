This is a quick and dirty humidity sensor and thermistor reading web server. It just takes the humidity sensor and thermistor readings and responds to http requests with them.

It uses the enc28j60 and ethershield libraries from http://trollmaker.com/article11/arduino-1-0-with-enc28j60-ethernet-shield-v1-1
